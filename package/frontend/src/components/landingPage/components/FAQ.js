              Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers securely. Each block contains a list of transactions and is linked to the previous block, forming a chain. This technology ensures data integrity and transparency, making it ideal for secure and tamper-proof record-keeping.

              RECs are market-based instruments that represent the environmental attributes of electricity generated from renewable energy sources. Each REC certifies the generation of one megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable energy and can be traded to provide financial support to renewable energy projects.

              Blockchain technology ensures transparency, security, and efficiency in the trading of RECs. By tokenizing RECs as NFTs, each certificate is uniquely identifiable and easily transferable on a digital marketplace, reducing transaction times and costs, and eliminating the need for intermediaries.
